Dhoni has captained the most international matches and is the most successful Indian captain with wins in the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, the 2011 Cricket World Cup, the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy and the Asia Cup in 2010, 2016 and 2018.

            <p>The Indian ODI team in the early 2000s saw Rahul Dravid as the wicket-keeper to ensure that the wicket-keeper spot didn't lack in batting talent and also tried other wicket-keeper/batsmen like Parthiv Patel and Dinesh Karthik.[34] With Dhoni performing well for the India A squad, he was picked in the ODI squad for the Bangladesh tour in December 2004.[35] Dhoni made his debut in the first match of the series and was run out for a duck.[36] Dhoni was picked for the subsequent ODI series against Pakistan.[37] In the second match of the series in Visakhapatnam, Dhoni playing in his fifth one-day international, scored 148 runs off 123 deliveries which surpassed the earlier record for the highest score by an Indian wicket-keeper.[38] Dhoni played in the Sri Lankan bilateral ODI series in October–November 2005 and was promoted to No. 3 in the batting order in the third ODI at Jaipur where he scored an unbeaten 183 runs off 145 balls, winning the game for India.[
